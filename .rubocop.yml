# Most have explanations, so if you wonder why this was done in a particular

# I don't expect to use any Unicode/UTF-8 characters in the codebase, and
# testing Ruby version 1.9.3 fails rubocop test if this cop is enabled.
# Development is done on 2.1.0, so I could either allow failures for any

# Most projects I work on have this length restriction, as 80 charachters are
# too few for some of the longer expressions with expressive variable names.
# The alternative is to spend more time scaffolding helper methods that do a
# single thing to shorten the code, but that adds layers of indirection and
# complexity.
# One might also use single-character variable assignment, but I believe that
# is a foolish choice in any but the simplest of single-line iterator methods.

# This case determines the use of the %r for auto-escaping regexes with paths
# in them. Since these largely come from external sources, and have little
# bearing on the code included in the library, disable this style.
